## Let's simulate something

I have a function

```{r}
sim_mean_sd = function(n, mu = 3, sigma = 4) {
  
  sim_data = 
    tibble(
    x = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma),
  )
  
  sim_data %>% 
    summarize(
      mu_hat = mean(x),
      sigma_hat = sd(x)
    )
}
```

I can "simulate" by running this line

```{r}
sim_mean_sd(30)
```

Let's simulate a lot
